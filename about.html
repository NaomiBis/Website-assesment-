		<h2>What is 4IR?</h2>
		
		<p> <!---what 4IR is--->
		The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is identified as the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds,
		as well as the growing use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, robotics,
		3D printing, the Internet of Things (IOT), and advanced wireless technologies.

        </p>

        <p>
            4IR allows us to move into a greater manufacturing, food-producing and service-driven economy,
            rather than our current economy that controls valuable assets and a large labor force.

		<h1> About 4IR </h1>
		<h2> 4IR explained </h2>
		
		<p>
		Internet of things
Internet of things (IOT) technology, which is designed to establish a connection between the physical and digital worlds, has changed numerous sectors. Billions of devices are already interconnected and more and more devices are becoming smart.
Cobots
Robotics is constantly evolving and the cobots, specially designed to interact physically with humans in collaborative environments, will be key to industry. Among other things, they optimise production and save employees from doing monotonous and dangerous tasks.
Augmented reality and virtual reality
Augmented reality and virtual reality, technologies that combine the real world and the digital world using computer science, enrich the visual experience of both users and consumers by generating immersive experiences.
 Big data
Information is power. The full-blown Fourth Industrial Revolution will allow us to change data into information. Big data allows massive data management and interpretation for business purposes, which is particularly relevant when devising business strategies or making decisions.
3D and 4D printing
These days we have the means to develop prototypes — or products for sale — quickly, accurately and economically with 3D and 4D printing. This technology is becoming increasingly important in design, architecture, engineering
        </p>

          
		<h2> Benefits of the 4IR </h2>
		
		<p>
		-4IR will increase economic growth and people will be in a much stable and sustainable and more helpful place 
-There will be more jobs, along with more safety and security, education and skills transfer, secondary manufacturing (production) and innovation
